# Welcome


I have over 10 years of experience working in web development mostly as a full stack developer. Currently, I work as Technical lead at [Encora Inc](https://www.encora.com/), where I lead a cross-functional team, working on 4th ranked US based real estate product named [Movoto Real Estate](https://www.movoto.com/), which forms a bridge between seller, agent & potential buyers. I'm deeply passionate about creating good quality, high performing, distributed & scalable product. 

Previously, I worked at [Quikr](https://www.quikr.com/), building real estate portal [QuikrHomes](https://www.quikr.com/homes) up from scratch. Prior to that I was working at [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/) as part of checkout team. Also I have experience in working on a digital publishing platform product.

If you catch me outside of work, I'm an adventurous traveler, I love exploring new places, love driving too. When @ home you can find me looking over my plants on my balcony garden.

I also like meeting new people over a cup of coffee. Feel free to reach out at [manash.khamai@outlook.com](mailto:manash.khamai@outlook.com) or DM on Twitter **@MaK_mf**.
